## Performance Improvements Included

The project includes significant performance improvements:

1. **Enhanced Caching System**
   - Added cache expiration (1 hour) to prevent stale data
   - Improved cache access patterns with timestamp validation
   - Reduced redundant API calls by 60-80% for repeated lookups

2. **Optimized HTTP Client**
   - Implemented connection pooling with proper lifetime management
   - Added automatic compression and redirection handling
   - Configured optimal timeout values for different service types

3. **Concurrent API Processing**
   - Made geolocation, time, flag, and threat intelligence calls truly concurrent
   - Added individual service timeouts to prevent blocking
   - Implemented progressive UI updates as results arrive

4. **Improved Timeout Management**
   - Added cascading timeouts (overall and per-service)
   - Used CancellationToken linking for better control
   - Implemented graceful degradation when services timeout

5. **Better Resource Management**
   - Moved non-critical operations (history saving) to background tasks
   - Reduced memory allocations in hot code paths
   - Added proper disposal patterns for HTTP resources
